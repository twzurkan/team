# Team

This is the main repository for the backend and fronend of the teams project.  The whole project took about 20 hours.  I did spend some time on looking at login and punted for the time being as it started to open up a lot of holes (like change password, creating users, etc.).  I spent most of my time trying to remember my css.  I'm sorry it took so long.  I only got to work on weekends.  Thank you for the opportunity to complete this project as I thought it was fun.
